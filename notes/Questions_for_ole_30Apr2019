Questions for Ole about the phenology model for rec fishing data
1) I think i must be coding the offset wrong, as it doesn't seem to affect estimates. What do i need to do?

2) How should we ultimately choose number of knots and their location?

3) Some questions about my planned next steps:
  a) add random effect of year-fit a separate spline for year year?
  b) add random effect of site (fishing area)- little data for many areas, so.... intercept only? not sure what this means for splines exactly...
  c) add later years of catch/effort data and regulation data
  d) add presence/absence (i.e. detection) component of the model
